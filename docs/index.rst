Clickpecker: Yet another Android UI testing library
###################################################

What is Clickpecker?
====================

Clickpecker is an Android UI testing library written in Python and based on computer vision (via OpenCV) and text recognition (via Tesseract OCR).

**The main Clickpecker's idea - be as human-like as possible!**

Clickpecker allows you:

* Obtain coordinates of text elements and icons on Android device's screen
* Perform different actions on device's screen (e.g. tap, scroll, swipe)
* Perform ADB commands
* Use real devices via STF
* Organize your tests with py.test - a very powerfull testing framework
